These were some ongoing helpful patches I was
putting together for a GSoC'12 Tiano Core
project I was co-mentoring on implementing
the MP support protocol in OVMF.

I wonder what happened to jljusten's similar
work...

Since it's unlikely I'll return to these anytime
soon, they might as well live here instead of
a separate dead edk2 tree.
