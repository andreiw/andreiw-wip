Andrei Warkentin's Work-in-Progress
===================================

Actually, this is more like a cemetary for stuff
that is/was/could be useful, but doesn't really live
elsewhere.

Aside from my old and still not updated resume, there's
some old Linux work that I've done (but that is now
probably hopelessly out of date).

Maybe I'll move some more decrepit stuff here from my
college archives ;-).
