AOS
===

This is a simple example of how one would go about writing some stand-alone
code, meant to be booted by a Linux-compatible ARM bootloader. This particular
bit uses PIC-compiled code, and fixes up relocations and run-time, so there
is no need to know where it was loaded.

Building:
$ CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi- make

Booting (assuming Android):
$ fastboot boot boot/aos

Running (assuming Tegra 2, UARTB):
01234
DEAD
