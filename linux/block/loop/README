Loop device parser support.
===================================

These are my work-in-progress patches for developing
VHD/VMDK/qcow and other-virtual-disk support in loop device via
the addition of loop parser support and parser implementations.

VHD parser to-do:
1) Fixed-size VHDs (Done!)
2) Dynamic VHDs (Seemingly done!)
3) Differencing VHDs (Should be trivial, since it's a special
   case of dynamic VHDs)
4) Benching against exsting nbd/fuse-based solutions.
5) LRU/shrink enhancements for block bitmap cache.
6) Optimizations of read/write path.
7) Deal with HUGE VHDs - i.e. deal with not being able
   to keep BAT/bitmaps in memory at all.
8) Parser options and backwards-compat loop_info changes.

VHD spec is of course at:
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=23850

QCOW parser to-do:
1) Support RW on v1 (done!)
2) Support v2.
3) Support COW disks (painful, since there is no parent
   UUID to match against, necessitating some loop changes).
4) LRU/shrink enhancements for L2 tabs.
5) Deal with HUGE images - i.e. deal with not being able to
   keep L1 or L2s in memory at all.

Common:
1) Think about and split out common functionality: it's
   painful how similar both the VHD and QCOW parsers look,
   from an internal data structure POV.
2) The shrinking LRU cache is a common neccesity for both VHD
   and QCOW,
3) Think about a common interface for dealing with COW/differencing
   disks. It looks like change_fd is the right mechanism, just need
   to figure out how to prevent silly things from happening (or not?)
4) Deal with mounting same image multiple times on different loop
   devices - from a metadata point of view.

VMDK is coming next.

I think a hallmark of good design isn't just
time and space considerations, but also ease
of implementation. It's roughly 3 hours to
implement the QCOW (v1) logic and test. It's
been about 8 to implement and test dynamic
VHD - and you get better use of unallocated
space for QCOW.

Ex: for 100m qcow and VHD at default settings,
empty disks take up 448 and 2.5k respectively.
Formatted with mkfs.ext2, they take up 3.3m
and 24.3m respectively. Astounding.

Patches are now rebased to linux-next (as of 9/26/2011).
