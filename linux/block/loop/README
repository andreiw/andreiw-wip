Loop device parser support.
===================================

These are my work-in-progress patches for developing
VHD/VMDK/qcow and other-virtual-disk support in loop device via
the addition of loop parser support and parser implementations.

The first parser will be for VHD, in the following order of
implementation:
1) Fixed-size VHDs (Done!)
2) Dynamic VHDs (Needs write testing for larger images, RO works)
3) Differencing VHDs (Should be trivial, since it's a special
   case of dynamic VHDs)
4) Benching against exsting nbd/fuse-based solutions.
5) Optimizations of read/write path.
6) LRU/shrink enhancements for block bitmap cache.
7) Parser options and backwards-compat loop_info changes.

VHD spec is of course at:
