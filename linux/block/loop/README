Loop device parser support.
===================================

These are my work-in-progress patches for developing
VHD/VMDK/qcow and other-virtual-disk support in loop device via
the addition of loop parser support and parser implementations.

The first parser will be for VHD, in the following order of
implementation:
1) Fixed-size VHDs.
2) Dynamic VHDs.
3) Differencing VHDs.

VHD spec is of course at:
