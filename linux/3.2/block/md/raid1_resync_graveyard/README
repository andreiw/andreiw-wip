This is a graveyard for interesting, but ultimately unfeasable
ideas w.r.t. improving resync performance by monitoring REQ_DISCARD
requests.

This patch set against MD and mdadm extends the on-disk bitmap with an
in-use bit, and tracks REQ_DISCARD requests. Unfortunately, it's useless
for bitmap chunk sizes > 4k (because the likelyhood of doing 64m discards is nil).

0001-MD-Bitmap-version-cleanup.patch
0002-MD-RAID1-Optimize-synchronization-to-avoid-blocks-ma.patch                        

This patch attempts to improve on above by keeping ranges, and by
removing the on-disk changes (which are unnecessary, due to the way
fstrim and friends are used). However, it suffers from terrible
worst case memory usage - you can't do better than a bit per block, and you're
going to be in a world of pain if someone starts discarding every other 4K. Ex:
1 MB of RAM to describe 2 MB of "hole punched" disk.
