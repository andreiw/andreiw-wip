Xen 4.2 ARM port
================

This is a work-in-progress in trying to add ARM support
to latest Xen 4.2-unstable tree.

This is based off of the Samsung Xen 3.0 tree, which seems
to be a dead project (http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/XenARM)

Initial support is PV guests on ARMv7 on a Tegra 2 SoC.

Can't wait for the Cortex A15 ;-).

Plan of action:
1) Get all Xen common code building.
2) Get ARM bootstrap code in and boot to a BUG()
3) Start filling in missing bits.
4) ??? (write a book about porting Xen to $FAVORITE_ARCH)
5) Profit!

History

May 3 2011
----------

Initial commit, starting to clean stuff up.


May 4 2011
----------

Added support for platform-specific code to build system, for Tegra
building can be done with -

XEN_TARGET_PLAT=tegra XEN_TARGET_ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi- make

...not that it builds yet. More cleanup. More understanding of what
"public" interfaces are exposed to common code. I shoulds separate
internal stuff from "publics" to make at least other people's lives
a bit easier ;-). Old Xen 3.0 uses DACR to protect kernel from userspace,
probably going to go with a split TTBR0/TTBR1 model instead.
