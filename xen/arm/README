Xen 4.2 ARM port
================

This is a work-in-progress in trying to add ARM support
to latest Xen 4.2-unstable tree.

This is based off of the Samsung Xen 3.0 tree, which seems
to be a dead project (http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/XenARM)

Initial support is PV guests on ARMv7 on a Tegra 2 SoC.

Can't wait for the Cortex A15 ;-).
